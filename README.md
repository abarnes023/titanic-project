## Survival on the Titanic

This report investigates the data included in the dataset titanic_data.csv, downloaded from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)  for the final project of the [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170) free course.

The questions that this report tries to answer are: which factors were predictive of survival on the Titanic and can we build a model based on these factors to predict survival? The factors that were investigated include:
- Ticket class
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/ spouses aboard
- Number of parents/ children aboard
- Passenger fare
- Port of embarkation

The report uses a Logistic Regression model to investigate the factors that best predict survival.

For more detailed information on the dataset please visit [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), which is where Udacity obtained the data.

The Logistic Regression model and analysis in this report were created with references to the guides written by Susan Li on [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-logistic-regression-in-python-step-by-step-becd4d56c9c8), Kevin Markham's example on [Data School](http://www.dataschool.io/logistic-regression-in-python-using-scikit-learn/), and the blog post on [Data-Mania](http://www.data-mania.com/blog/logistic-regression-example-in-python/).

The Python libraries used in this analysis include:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
